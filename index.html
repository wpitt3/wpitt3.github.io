        <p> <b><a href="./board-game.html">Board Game Bot</a></b> I used Python Golang and TensorFlow to train bots to play board games, such as connect 4 and Azul, with reinforcement learning based around Neural Networks and a Monte Carlo Search Tree
        <p> <b><a href="./ner.html"/>Proper Name/Noun extraction</a></b> I used spaCy and knowledge bases to analyse books to find characters and places. I then used the context of the labeled data to find and label further examples within the text.
        <p> <b><a href="https://github.com/wpitt3/hangman">Impossible Hangman</a></b> I used minimax tree search to make a hangman game which altered the word the player was guessing ensuring that they took as many guesses as possible
        <p> <b><a href="https://github.com/wpitt3/football-league-positions">Football League Position Analysis</a></b> I developed software which analysed data on current table state and upcoming football fixtures to calculate and visualise the furthest a team could move within X weeks

        <h3> Qatalog, London - Senior Software developer</h3>
        <h5> April 2021 - October 2021</h5>
        <p> I worked as a full stack developer on the Javascript platform. I developed the existing Elasticsearch search to utilise the underlying network of user entities to power the relevancy. This allowed modification of search parameters in real time and enabled the option of linear regression to be used, optimising for the userâ€™s selected result, to reduce search time.
        <h3> Treatwell, London - Software developer</h3>
        <h5> August 2018 - April 2021</h5>
        <p> I developed the Java Spring services backend in a multidisciplinary Agile team which continuously delivers features for the mobile app. I have helped to build the application and infrastructure for the App API, which performs an automated red/black deployment with every merge to trunk as part of a Gitlab CI pipeline. In a small feature team, I developed a feature flagging framework which allows us to A/B test and dark deploy features in the production environment. I additionally organised bootstrapping learning groups, presenting topics around Spring and TDD. I have enjoyed improving Docker and AWS skills whilst at Treatwell and use them to debug and fix our development environments.
        <h3> Carsnip, Cardiff - Software developer</h3>
        <h5> May 2015 - July 2018</h5>
        <p> I worked as a developer constructing a car search engine using NLP to pick key features out of text based search terms. I developed on every part of the system, focusing on the microservices backend, which used Groovy, Vertx and Elasticsearch. I identified latency in the microservices and rewrote service clients adding load balancing, service discovery and circuit breakers. For our crawl pipeline, I used k-means clustering to identify websites with similar structures to improve our crawling efficiency. I trained members of the development team in coding practices, TDD and CI/CD. I represented my organisation as a technical expert at numerous conferences including; Web Summit (Dublin), CDX (Silverstone), Elasticon (San Francisco) and React Berlin.
        <h3> Multicom Products, Bristol - Junior  Software developer</h3>
        <h5> October 2013 - March 2015</h5>
        <p> I worked in an AGILE team on the Java backend of a search engine and was given the responsibilities of being a scrum master, training a junior developer, reviewing code and interviewing job applicants.
